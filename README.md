json is just text
can't use dot notation when there are spaces so use 
    testing["my thing"]

if you don't use curly brackets within the higher order function it's "implicit"

lodash

file system access

const file fs.readFileSync('./data.json')
    ./ means you're looking in the folder you're currently in
